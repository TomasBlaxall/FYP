# 405nm Maskless Photolithography System - Direct Laser Writer
My final year project at university, this repository is intended as a summary of the project so far, whilst not summative in nature, it is intended to provide a good overview of the system as a whole. The projects section of this repository contains more granular information about the process of development and implementation.
## Finished System Summary
The project is still a work in progress, watch this space! Once completed this section will be updated.
## Archival Summary Area
This is not summative of all of the work that was done as of course this is being done in retrospect. Having said that, this section readme specifically will attempt to capture a cross-sectional overview of elements of the development.
